Privacy PolicySession Draft
Effective Date: February 8, 20261. IntroductionSession Draft is a mobile application designed for therapy and care professionals to organize session reflections and draft notes in a private, offline environment.

We are committed to protecting your privacy by design. Session Draft was intentionally built to operate without collecting, transmitting, or storing user data on external servers.

This Privacy Policy explains how Session Draft handles information and outlines your responsibilities when using the app.2. Data CollectionSession Draft does not collect, transmit, or store user data on our servers.

• We do not operate servers or backend systems.
• We do not collect personal information.
• We do not use analytics, tracking tools, or third-party data services.
• We do not share data with third parties.

Any information you enter into Session Draft exists only on your device and is not transmitted to us.3. Local Data Storage• All session content and app data are stored locally on your device.
• Data is encrypted at rest using industry-standard encryption (AES-256 via SQLCipher).
• We, as the developer, do not have access to your data.
• Storage location and behavior vary by platform (iOS or Android).
• Session Draft does not provide cloud storage, synchronization, or remote access of any kind.4. No Network Activity• Session Draft operates fully offline.
• No internet connection is required for normal operation.
• The app does not transmit data to external servers.
• No background network activity occurs.
• On Android, internet permissions are explicitly removed.
• All functionality is available without connectivity.5. User Responsibilities and Protected InformationSession Draft is designed to be used without storing protected health information (PHI).

• Users are responsible for the content they enter into the app.
• Users are strongly encouraged to avoid entering client-identifying information or other sensitive data.
• Session Draft does not enforce or validate content entry.
• Exporting content from Session Draft transfers responsibility to the user. Once exported, data is subject to the policies, protections, and behaviors of the destination app, device, or platform.6. Export and Sharing• Session Draft provides manual export features using your device’s native operating system capabilities.
• Export options may include clipboard copy, plain text files, or PDF.
• All export actions are initiated entirely by the user.
• We do not control, monitor, or restrict how exported data is used or stored.
• Users are responsible for ensuring exported content complies with their professional, ethical, and legal requirements.7. Data DeletionYou remain in full control of your data.

• Individual sessions may be deleted at any time within the app.
• All local data may be deleted via the Settings screen.
• Uninstalling the app typically removes all locally stored data, subject to device behavior.
• Because no data is stored on external servers, there is no remote data to delete.8. Device Backups• Depending on your device and settings, system-level backups (such as iCloud or Google Drive) may include app data.
• Backup behavior is controlled by your device and account settings.
• We do not manage, initiate, or control device-level backups.
• Users should review their device backup preferences if this is a concern.9. HIPAA and Regulatory ConsiderationsSession Draft is not designed to store or manage protected health information.

• Session Draft is not a HIPAA storage system.
• Session Draft is not an Electronic Health Record (EHR).
• Session Draft is not a documentation, billing, or compliance system.

The app is intended solely for personal reflection and note drafting. Users are responsible for ensuring their own compliance with professional, ethical, and regulatory obligations.10. Children’s PrivacySession Draft is a professional tool intended for licensed therapy and care professionals and is not designed for use by anyone under the age of 18.

We do not knowingly collect personal information from any users.11. Changes to This PolicyWe may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes to the app or legal requirements.

Updates will be reflected within the app. Continued use of Session Draft after changes indicates acceptance of the revised policy.12. ContactIf you have questions about this Privacy Policy, you may contact:Email: relentlesslyfair+sessiondraft@gmail.com
